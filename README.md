# Coal Bag Plugin

Adds a counter to the coal bag addon.

## Description

The plugin is simple, it adds a counter to the coal bag to tell you how much coal is in the coal bag. The counter only updates when you add coal manually into the bag. It will not update when coal is added automatically while the bag is opened.

This plugin was mostly copied from [Adam's esspouch](https://github.com/Adam-/runelite-plugins/blob/esspouch/src/main/java/info/sigterm/plugins/esspouch/EssPouchPlugin.java) plugin.
