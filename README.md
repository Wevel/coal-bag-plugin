# Coal Bag Addon
The coal bag plugin adds a counter to the coal bag to tell you how much coal is in the bag. The plugin will not remember how much coal is in the bag from the last login, and will reset any time the plugin is reloaded.

### Todo
- [X] Setup plugin from the initial template.
- [X] Add a counter to the coal bag.
- [X] Make the counter only appear on the coal bag.
- [X] Have counter reset to zero when checking a empty coal bag.
- [X] Make it so that the counter updates when adding coal to the bag.
- [ ] Make it so that the counter updates when removing coal from the bag.

### Known Issues
-  Plugin only knows how much coal is in the bag when you are filling it manually. Filling it by keeping the pouch open will not update the counter.

### Contributors
Most of the plugin was inspired by and copied from Adams EssencePouch plugin. Feel free to modify and redistribute this as you wish.
